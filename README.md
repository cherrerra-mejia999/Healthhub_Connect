# Healthhub_Connect
This will be a collaboration website which we will make a mock website where people can store important health details. 

The database for HealthHub Connect is located on Supabase and is private. And the code can be loaded on to VS Code to access it. There is no specific dependencies or configuration details that needs to be done in order to access the project.

To access the the website, simply go to the browser and plug in "https://cherrerra-mejia999.github.io/Healthhub_Connect/".
